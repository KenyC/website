<em>Relative clauses; interactions with modals and definite article choice in Fering and Akan (2017)</em><br /><a href="resources/docs/RCAndArticleChoice_v1.pdf"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></span></a> (LF reading group presentation)
<!-- <p>in this talk, i propose a different semantics for relative clauses that brings them closer to the semantics of conjoined sentences. this accounts for the intuition that in many cases (albeit not all), a sentence with a relative clause is paraphrasable as a conjunction of two clauses. i explore two consequences of this idea in two unrelated areas.</p> -->
<!-- <p> -->
<!-- first, i show that this semantics can improve over the standard grosu & krifka (2007)'s account of intensional relative clauses (as in (3)), in that it avoids postulating type-shifters that are specific to this construction and it does not posit higher-order abstraction.  -->

<!-- (3) the gifted mathematician you claim to be should be able to solve this problem in no time. -->

<!-- second, i show that this semantics can explain interactions between relative clauses and the choice of the definite article in languages with the weak/strong definite article distinction. while strong articles are standardly taken to be anaphoric to previously mentioned entities (schwarz 2012), they can appear in combination with a restrictive relative clause even when no previous referent is available. however, using the strong form in contexts where they are not licensed is not possible in all languages that make the weak/strong distinction: while fering can, akan and haitian creole cannot. i account for this split in terms of the syntax/semantics interface given here.</p> -->

<em>A mixed approach to the semantics of "different" (2015)</em><br /> 
<span class="fa fa-info collapsible"></span> (Semantics 1st year squib)
<p style="display: none;">In this squib, I argue that Charnavel (2015)'s uniform approach to the meanings of "different" can successfully be turned into a movement analysis, where "different" is a scopal element (as in Barker 2007).
This move is shown to be crucial if we want to account for readings of "different" under modal predicates. The scopal analysis of "different" also suggests that internal adjectives fall into one of two categories: scopal internal adjectives (like "different") and inert internal adjectives (like "neighboring"). Empirical tests can successfully distinguish the two categories.</p>

<em>Compositionality can solve Carnap's problem for natural languages (2015)</em><br />
<span class="fa fa-info collapsible"></span> (CogMaster's mini-stage)
<p style="display: none;">Carnap has shown that one cannot retrieve the reference of logical terms from the patterns of inference they give rise to. Translated to natural languages, this means that functional elements (like <em>every</em>, <em>and</em>) cannot be acquired solely on the basis of entailments between sentences. Bonnay proved that Carnap's problem vanishes if we take compositionality to be a semantic universal (with some other minor assumptions). In this paper, I show that this result extends to the kind of trivalent first-order logic that is suited to deal with presuppositions.</p>

<h2><span>Miscellaneous</span></h2>
Some informal notes about formal language theory:
<ul class="papers">
    <li>
        <em>Context-free languages: a constructive characterization (2020)</em><br />
        <a href="resources/docs/CfGrammars.pdf"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></span></a> 
        <a href="https://github.com/KenyC/CF"><span class="fa fa-github"></span></a> 
        <span class="fa fa-info collapsible"></span>
        <p style="display: none;">In this note, I propose to characterize a constructive characterization of the class of context-free languages. The goal is to have a characterization similar to the characterization of the class of rational languages, as the smallest class of languages closed under some natural operations. The operations proposed are union, concatenation and &#955;-abstraction and fixed-point. This allows to expand the notion of context-free languages to arbitrary monoids and other weaker structures (e.g. trees). The proposal is illustrated with some Haskell code.

<li>
        <em>Universal languages (2017)</em><br />
        <a href="resources/docs/UniversalLanguages.pdf"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></span></a> 
        <span class="fa fa-info collapsible"></span>
        <p style="display: none;">This is an attempt to elucidate the difference between two different views on the nature of UG: one view according to which UG specifies a class of languages ; one view according to which UG specifies a singe formal language and different mappings to the interface produce different languages. I show that the latter take is only compatible with certain classes of formal languages, such as the class of context-free languages, while certain others, such as the class of mildly context-sensitive languages aren't. </p>

I am the author of the Exh Python PIP package to automate the computation of innocent exclusion exhaustification.

<ul class="papers">
    <li>
        <em>Exh for Python</em><br />
        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Exh/"><span class="fa fa-file-code-o"></span></a> 
        <a href="https://github.com/KenyC/Exh"><span class="fa fa-github"></span></a> 
        <span class="fa fa-info collapsible"></span>
        <p style="display: none;">This Python library can compute the exhaustified meaning of a formula. It computes maximal consistent sets, innocently excludable alternatives, innocently includable alternatives. It can deal with recursive Exhaustified formula and replicates Fox (2007)'s Free Choice account. Install with "pip install exh".</p>
